Bootstrapper
============
Plug and play system that allows you to push updates/new content for installed cordova app. This gives more control for pushing your updates and avoids web store update system.


Platform
============
Android       - tested   
iOS           - not tested   
Windows phone - not tested   
 

Installation
============
1. Copy bootstrapper.html, bootstrapper.js and bootstrapperConfig.js to '../your_cordova_project/www'.
2. Set in '../your_cordova_project/config.xml' path to bootstrapper.html: <content src="bootstrapper.html" />.
3. add app.zip to '../your_cordova_project/www'. The archive app.zip should contain www directory with your app files.
4. add cordova.zip to '../your_cordova_project/www'. The archive should contain cordova.js, cordova_plugins.js and directory "plugins" with plugins. Note that all content of cordova.zip should correspont to the specific platform you are working with. In this repository 'www/cordova.zip' file corresponds to android platform.
5. optionally content zip files could be added to '../your_cordova_project/www'. 
6. add version.json, app.zip and optionally content.zip to your update_server. DropBox is ok too :).
7. install all dependencies.

All of the added content would be unpacked at the first run of the application.
